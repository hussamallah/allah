# Seeker $7 Fracture Unlock Flow - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of the Seeker $7 fracture unlock flow, which provides users with a 7-question diagnostic journey to reveal their core patterns and receive personalized insights.

## Flow Architecture

### 1. Entry Point
- **Location**: `/chamber/[archetype]/who-you-are`
- **Trigger**: User clicks "Face My Truth — $7" button
- **Action**: Calls payment API, then redirects to fracture flow

### 2. Payment Processing
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/fracture-payment`
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Handles $7 payment processing (placeholder implementation)
- **Response**: Payment confirmation with success status

### 3. Fracture Flow Journey
- **Location**: `/chamber/[archetype]/fracture-flow`
- **Steps**: 
  1. Welcome overlay (payment confirmation)
  2. 7 diagnostic questions
  3. Review screen with insights

### Seeker-Specific Questions

The flow includes 7 carefully crafted questions designed to reveal Seeker patterns:

1. **Truth Avoidance**: "What truth have you stopped looking for because it hurt too much?"
2. **Pattern Recognition**: "What loop do you keep reliving, even when you know it's a trap?"
3. **Closure Issues**: "What place or person do you keep moving away from without real closure?"
4. **Hidden Honesty**: "What is the most honest thing you've never said out loud—even to yourself?"
5. **Future Fear**: "What future version of you scares you too much to build?"
6. **Empty Giving**: "When did you last give from emptiness—hoping it would make you feel full?"
7. **Identity Mask**: "What role have you played so well that it became your identity?"
