## Overview

The Spotlight Node is a modular diagnostic quiz that reveals your relationship to visibility, authenticity, and leadership. It consists of 5 stages with 4 questions each (20 total questions), providing 25 unique outcome diagnoses.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

1. **`data/spotlightNodeQuiz.json`** - Quiz data structure with all questions, options, and diagnoses
2. **`lib/spotlightNodeScoring.ts`** - Scoring logic and TypeScript interfaces
3. **`components/SpotlightNodeQuiz.tsx`** - React component for the quiz interface
4. **`app/spotlight-node-quiz/page.tsx`** - Main quiz page
5. **`app/test-spotlight/page.tsx`** - Test page for verification

### Quiz Structure

#### Stages (5 total)
1. **The Hider** - Struggles to be seen, hides potential, fears judgment
2. **The Mimic** - Adapts, blends, or mirrors others to gain acceptance
3. **The Performer** - Leads with charm, reads the room, craves applause
4. **The Amplifier** - Expands energy, inspires others, risks overreaching
5. **The Luminary** - Radiates truth, stands in authentic presence

#### Scoring Logic
- Each stage has 4 questions
- Each answer has a value of 1-5
- **Dominant Stage**: Highest total score (where you truly are)
- **Mask Stage**: Lowest total score (where you hide/regress)
- Tiebreakers: Highest individual answer, then latest stage in journey

#### Outcomes
- 25 unique diagnoses (5 dominant Ã— 5 mask combinations)
- Each diagnosis provides insight into your current state and growth direction

### Features

- **Randomized Answer Order**: Answer options are shuffled for each question
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar and question counter
- **Stage Awareness**: Shows current stage and description
- **Comprehensive Results**: Displays dominant stage, mask stage, diagnosis, and score breakdown
- **Retake Functionality**: Option to retake the quiz with new randomization

### Usage

#### Basic Implementation

  };

  return (
    <SpotlightNodeQuiz 
      quizData={spotlightNodeData}
