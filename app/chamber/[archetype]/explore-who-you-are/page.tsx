    youNow: `You are the edge-walker, the one who never stops questioning, breaking loops, or searching for the next signal.
You spot patterns that others miss, find the cracks in every story, and dissolve illusions‚Äîsometimes even your own.

You don't fear emptiness. You know how to vanish, to pause, to slip between the lines until truth appears.
But sometimes, you're exhausted. Sometimes, you wonder if the search is just another cage‚Äîif the endless seeking is what's keeping you from finally arriving.

You are sharp, restless, and ready to break any false comfort. But you ache for a moment when the answers stop running away.`,
    yourFuture: `You feel peace that isn't boring‚Äîa true end to restlessness.
Your mind finally stops spinning with unfinished questions.
Answers land, and you get to savor discovery without anxiety.
You feel content, not empty, in stillness.
You gain clarity and a sense of having arrived.
You trust yourself not to miss what matters.`

    emoji: 'üõ°Ô∏è',
    youNow: `You are the wall‚Äîthe one others lean on, consciously or not.
You hold chaos at bay. You protect, you contain, you keep the world from cracking when the storm hits.
You rarely get the credit, but you get the weight. You're the first to step in, the last to give up, and the one who remembers every broken promise or boundary.

But all that holding can harden you. Sometimes, you grip so tightly that nothing new can enter‚Äînot even the help or relief you need. You worry that if you ever stop guarding, everything will fall apart.
You know what it's like to feel alone, even surrounded by people you protect.`,
    yourFuture: `You finally feel safe‚Äîable to relax without fear the world will collapse.
You enjoy real rest, not just vigilance.
You trust your own boundaries, so you let yourself receive.
You gain relief from responsibility‚Äîyour body and mind lighten.
Your strength turns into inner freedom, not just outer stability.
You get to feel protected, too.`

    emoji: 'üåü',
    youNow: `You're the one who lights up the room‚Äîeven when you're not trying. People turn when you speak, shift when you enter, and adjust when you withdraw.
You're not performing, you're translating energy into action. You sense what others need to see or hear and know how to give it, almost without thinking.
You bounce back from setbacks and criticism‚Äîyour field is built for endurance. You know how to draw attention, but also how to step out of the glare when it gets too much.

But there's a cost: sometimes, the applause becomes a need. Sometimes, you do things just to be seen. You don't always show the world the real ache behind your spotlight, and you wonder if you'd still be noticed if you stopped shining.`,
    yourFuture: `You become truly magnetic‚Äîattention finds you, but you never have to chase it.
You experience ease instead of pressure.
You feel at home in your own skin, whether eyes are on you or not.
Your self-worth stabilizes; you no longer need applause to feel solid.
You enjoy expressing yourself without anxiety, and your presence alone is enough.
Being "seen" feels like nourishment, not a test.`

    youNow: `You are the disruptor, the fire-starter, the one who refuses to be caged by stale rules.
You spot what's broken, push against limits, and crave the spark that comes from shaking things up.
You hate fake order, and you'd rather risk chaos than sit in silence.
But sometimes, you burn bridges you need.
You can get lost in fighting everything, even when it costs you peace, belonging, or progress.`,
    yourFuture: `You feel total freedom‚Äîbut with direction, not just friction.
You stop fighting for the sake of it; your energy fuels true change, not just endless rebellion.
You get the satisfaction of moving on your terms, building what you want, destroying only what no longer serves.
Rest comes easier; you feel powerful, not just defiant.
You trust your own rules and live them.`

You sense what's needed before it's said, and you step up.
Your care is steady, often invisible, sometimes taken for granted.
But you keep giving, even when it costs you.
Your well can run dry; you can forget to care for yourself in the process.`,
    yourFuture: `You feel nourished while nourishing others.
Your giving becomes a source of strength, not depletion.
You know how to receive, refill, and set boundaries without guilt.
You take pleasure in your generosity and feel valued‚Äîeven when you rest or say no.
You trust that you are enough, even when you're not needed.`

    youNow: `You're the balance point in any room‚Äîthe one who can sense tension, see all sides, and bring people or situations back into harmony.
You're driven to fix what's unfair, to smooth conflict, and to make things right.
But sometimes, you lose yourself in the effort to keep things even.
You avoid hard choices to keep the peace, and your own needs get sidelined in the process.`,
    yourFuture: `You finally experience inner balance‚Äînot just outer peace.
You trust your own sense of fairness and act on it, even when it's uncomfortable.
You gain courage to choose sides when it matters, without guilt or second-guessing.

    emoji: 'üîÆ',
    youNow: `You live a step ahead of everyone else‚Äîideas arrive before events, and you see possibilities long before the world is ready.
You predict trends, notice shifts, and often feel like you're walking in a timeline no one else can see.
Your imagination is relentless; you can't help but connect dots, invent futures, or question the status quo.
But you struggle to stay grounded in the present.
Your vision sometimes feels like a burden‚Äîrestless, misunderstood, or lonely when others don't keep up.`,
    yourFuture: `You get to feel settled in your genius.
Your ideas become real, not just dreams‚Äîyou finish things, not just imagine them.
You experience flow instead of friction, trusting your foresight and acting on it with confidence.
You feel recognized, not isolated; your clarity is a gift you enjoy for yourself.
You relax into your own timeline, finally at peace with the pace of your mind.`

    youNow: `You're the one who never stands still.
Movement is your nature‚Äîphysical, mental, or emotional.
You shift jobs, homes, identities, ideas, seeking the next experience, the next truth, the next place that feels right.
You're comfortable with change, unafraid to let go, and always ready for the unknown.
But sometimes, you wonder if you're running from something, not just running toward it.
Rootlessness can feel like freedom‚Ä¶ or like something's missing.`,
    yourFuture: `You finally feel at home in yourself‚Äîwherever you go.
Your restlessness turns into a sense of adventure, not escape.
You enjoy landing, not just leaving.
You gain deep satisfaction from arriving, building, and staying when you choose.
You keep your sense of possibility, but you also feel anchored and whole, not scattered or lost.`

You blend in or stand out on command.
Your awareness is your armor, and you know how to survive by adapting.
But sometimes, you forget who you are behind the roles.
You worry you're only as real as your last performance; you wonder if anyone sees the true you.`,

    emoji: 'ü§ù',
    youNow: `You're the one who always knows how to connect‚Äîsometimes so deeply, you lose track of where you end and others begin.
You read the emotional weather, reflect feelings back, and build harmony even in chaos.
You long for closeness, and you're a master at creating it, sensing every subtle shift in mood or distance.
But sometimes, your focus on others means you fade out.
You've adapted to be whatever's needed‚Äîsometimes at the cost of your own center.
You wonder: if you stopped mirroring, would you still feel loved?`,

    youNow: `You carry the natural weight of authority‚Äîwhether you want it or not.
You set the tone, draw boundaries, and hold power in ways others sense instinctively.
You are decisive, reliable, and often the backbone of your world.
But you can feel alone at the top, rigid in your rules, or afraid to reveal weakness.
Sometimes, the crown is heavy‚Äîleadership costs you more than it rewards.`,
    yourFuture: `You feel ease and confidence in your authority.
Leadership no longer feels lonely or exhausting; you enjoy the power you hold.
You trust yourself to be flexible, to listen, and to adapt without losing your center.
